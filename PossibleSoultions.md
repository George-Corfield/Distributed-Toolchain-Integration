## Summary
The Solution can be made from combinations of the following front and backends.

## Front End

### Web-App

A web app can be used for the front end. This will provide the users with a full Graphical User Interface that is accessible through any web browser. It is likely that this solution will use a server or cloud backend. 

| Pros| Cons| 
| ----- | ----------- | 
| Full Graphical user interface. | Maintenance will be needed. |
| Accessible through any web browser. |  |


### Desktop-App

A Desktop app can be used for the front end. This can use any of the suggested backends.

| Pros| Cons| 
| ----- | ----------- | 
| Full Graphical User Interface. | Maintenance will be difficult as regular updates are needed. |
| Compatible with any backend type. | Different versions for different operating systems are needed. |

### Command-Line
This is the simplest way to communicate with the backend. A set of simple commands can be made to send the data to the backend. Would work best with a local backend.

| Pros| Cons| 
| ----- | ----------- | 
| Very simple, practically no maintenance needed. | No/limited Graphical User Interface. |
|  | Different versions for different operating systems are needed. |

## Back End

### Local
The backend can be stored locally on each machine. 

| Pros| Cons| 
| ----- | ----------- | 
| Simple to maintain. | Low/no security measures needed. |
| Files will not be sent across the internet improving security and speed. | Different versions for different operating systems are needed. |
| Cheap. | All the simulation software and modules must be installed on each machine and cannot be shared easily. |
|  | Speed dependent on the chosen machine and cannot be altered. |

### Server
The backend can be run on a server owned by the client.

| Pros| Cons| 
| ----- | ----------- | 
| Complete control over the server. | It may take longer as the file will have to be sent to the server. |
| Easier to develop and test. | Strong security measures needed. | 
|  | Low/No fault tolerance. | 
|  | Expensive as the server must be bought and maintained. | 
|  | Limited ability to scale the system. | 

### Cloud
The backend can be stored in the cloud. 

| Pros| Cons| 
| ----- | ----------- | 
| The server is not your responsibility to maintain. | It may take longer as the file will have to be sent to the server. |
| Strong fault tolerant. | Strong security measures needed. | 
| Speed dependent on the speed of the server, so it can be increased and decreased. | Expensive as you must pay for the use of the server. | 
| Easy to scale the system. |  |
