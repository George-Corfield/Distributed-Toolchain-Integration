## Web App

A web app can be used to solve this problem. It will be accessed across the internet using an internet browser. This will allow for a Graphical User Interface. This will also allow the system to be accessible through the internet. The system will need appropriate security to deal with the issues that can arise from this.

## Desktop App

## Server Calculations
A server can be set up, that can be accessed locally using a simple script or the command line. It will receive requirements and the component data and then it will iterate on the component and send back the parameters. This solution will require the smallest code base however it could be difficult to use without a graphical user interface. This solution will work best in a local environment. This is for security reasons, as if the system is accessible through the internet then anyone will be able to send network traffic to it which can result in targeted cyber attacks. These attacks could attempt to steal data from the system or just disable it entirely. A firewall and authentication can be used to alleviate these threats.


| Pros| Cons| 
| ----- | ----------- | 
| No data is stored on the system so security issues are much simpler to navigate. | It may take longer as the file will have to be resent to the server every time calculations are done. |
| The system will be much easier to maintain as less technologies will be used to build it. | Allowing traffic from the internet can lead to cyber attacks that extra security is needed to deal with. |
